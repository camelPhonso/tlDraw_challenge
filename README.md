# tldraw take-home

## Notes on the execution
The code to this challenge has been commit via separate branches.
- one branch was used to work on the basic stickers functionality
- one branch was used for the stretch goal

For the stretch goal I chose to complete issue #2 - Users want to be able to reposition or delete used stickers

The code base is layed out in order of complexity and with the code for the stretch goal at the bottom.
Minimal commentary was kept in some lines and functions are separated by markers for ease of read.
